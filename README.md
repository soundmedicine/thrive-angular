# Thrive! App

Charting application built in collaboration with data from research on child growth and development at high altitudes, conducted since 2000 by Dr. Christine Ebert-Santos at Ebert Family Clinic.

The application allows users to view growth standards from birth to 24 months of age, and enter growth rates to be compared on a line chart.

Currently deployed to http://thriveapp.surge.sh.
Back-end deployed to https://thrive-server.herokuapp.com (at endpoints '/females' and   '/males').
