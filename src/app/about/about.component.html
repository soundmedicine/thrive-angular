<h5 class="center">A high-altitude perspective</h5>
<p>Children born at high-altitude often grow at rates different from those born at sea level. Research done by Dr. Christine Ebert-Santos over the past 8 years has shown that growth rates at altitudes above 2500 m -- determined by head circumference, length, height and weight recorded for thousands of well-child examinations -- are consistently slower than those of children born at lower elevations. Children born at high altitude have also shown a longer period of growth, however, and will often catch up to statistically common size into adolescence. Because studies of child growth rates at high altitudes are still relatively recent, underfunded, and under-researched, children from high altitude communities are still compared to standards from low elevations, constantly misdiagnosed in spite of showing growth consistent with standards at high altitudes, and consequently prescribed inappropriate treatment. It is the goal of this application to provide an accurate and insightful comparison for medical practicioners and parents of children in high altitude communities.</p>
